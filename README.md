#H1N1 Vaccine Prediction

#Overview
Yakesh Choudhery is an exciting machine learning project developed during my internship at Yhills in collaboration with IT Hyderabad. The project revolves around predicting H1N1 vaccine recipients using demographic, opinion, and health behavior data from the National 2009 H1N1 Flu Survey (NHFS) conducted during the H1N1 influenza pandemic.

#Problem Statement
During my internship, I focused on predicting whether individuals received the H1N1 vaccine based on the NHFS survey responses. This involved analyzing their backgrounds, opinions, and health behaviors. Understanding vaccination patterns is crucial for future public health efforts.

#Approach
Throughout the internship, I performed data preprocessing, explored the dataset, and engineered relevant features. I experimented with various machine learning models, fine-tuned them, and evaluated their performance using cross-validation techniques.

#Key Takeaways
Exciting internship experience at Yhills, collaborating with IT Hyderabad.
Hands-on application of machine learning to predict H1N1 vaccine recipients.
Gained insights into public health response during a major pandemic.
Explored data analysis, model building, and evaluation techniques.
Contributed to future public health strategies.

#Note
The privacy and confidentiality of survey respondents were strictly maintained throughout the project. The results are purely for research and educational purposes.
